  "about_us": [
    "NUS Netball Recreational Club (NUS NRC) is a group that welcomes all netball enthusiasts, regardless of gender and playing experience. All that is required is a set of sports attire, a water bottle and a general interest in sports! Our warm and friendly exco team will take it from there. NRC's training sessions are carefully planned to cater to beginners as we teach you the fundamentals of the sport. You can also look forward to be engaged in fun-filled netball games with fellow members every session!",
    "NRC has recently implemented a new approach towards membership as we take in official members who share the same passion for netball. This closed membership allows us to focus on each and every members' needs and interests. With this, we hope that our members will be able to play netball confidently as we journey through fundamentals, drills, internal leagues and Netballuxion (an annual street Netball competition organised by NRC) together.",
    "As much as stepping is a foul on court, we envision our members to be stepping out of their comfort zone to come together with open communication and feedback during trainings.",
    "Netball is an exciting sport played by 2 teams of 7, with each team aiming to score as many goals as possible. Netball relies on tactics more than timeouts while shooters require accuracy and not a backboard. Every position plays a part in bringing the ball down the court. Just as Netball depends on an entire squad and not one superstar, NUS NRC focuses on every one of our members within this big family. We make it our mission to know one another on a personal basis and form long lasting, genuine friendships.",
