  "about_us": [
    "\"Ai\" refers to harmony, \"ki\" refers to spirit or energy while \"do\" refers to the path or the way. So when added together, Aikido is the way of the spirit of harmony. Aikido is a true budo or martial way that evolved in the historic tradition of Japanese warrior arts. Budo is more than a science of tactics and self-defence. It is a discipline for perfecting the spirit of the practitioner. Aikido is a paradox: it is an extremely effective form of self-defence but it is also considered by many to be a path of peace and reconciliation.",
    "We are a community of kind and compassionate people who trains with utmost respect, discipline and enthusiasm.",
    "Respect and care for the safety of those who they practice with. Respect and adhere to the Dojo Etiquette.",
