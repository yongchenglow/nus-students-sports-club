      "NUS Nam Wah Pai Self-Defence (NWPSD) is a martial arts club formed with the aim to promote good health and to teach the art of self-defense. We are affiliated with World Nam Wah Pai which was established in Singapore since 1964. To date, many branches have been established in Singapore, New Zealand, Japan, China and Malaysia. Our martial arts form tends towards practicality and is based on a flexible system of strikes and grapples.",
      "Our club is very supportive of each other and we will not hesitate to help each other during event planning and should any unforeseen circumstances arise. Despite the challenges we face in event planning, we remain close knit and we'll always have each others' backs."
